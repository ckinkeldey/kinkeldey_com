I am passionate about research, teaching, and software development in the field of geovisualization and visual analytics with over 15 years of professional experience in research and industry. Holding a PhD on the topic of uncertainty visualization in geoinformatics I am leveraging knowledge and principles from cartography for interactive visual data analysis and interpretable machine learning. My main research interest is how visual communication of uncertainty can support people to gain a better understanding of complex information.
